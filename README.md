# Competitive-Programming-List
I'll be adding codes to some of the must-practice CP problems. I'll try to categorise them as much as possible and arrange problems in increasing order of difficulty for a particular category. 

Ping me on my mail id : [thesahilmalhotra@gmail.com](mailto:thesahilmalhotra@gmail.com) if you have some suggestions or want to add problems. Please specify the source and category of the problem.

### 1. Introduction to Algorithms
These problems are purely implementational with a little bit of observation. Start with these to get the hang of writing problem solving codes. 

### 2. Recursion and Sorting
Before attempting these problems dive into concepts like recursion and get acquainted with some sorting techniques like quicksort and mergesort. 

### 3. Binary Search 
Read this [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/binary-search/) tutorial on Binary Search and then try to solve the problems in this section.  

### 4. Dynamic Programming
Refer to some training material from [IARCS](http://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/online-study-material/topics/dp-tiling.php). Also read this insightful [Quora Answer by Michal Danilák](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-good-resources-or-tutorials-for-dynamic-programming-DP-besides-the-TopCoder-tutorial/answer/Michal-Danil%C3%A1k) and then head onto this section to solve some dp problems.
